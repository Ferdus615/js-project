    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Each player starts with two cards.</li>
      <li>
        Aces can count as 1 or 11, face cards are worth 10, and all other cards
        are worth their face value.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep your
        current hand).
      </li>
      <li>If your total exceeds 21, you "bust" and lose the game.</li>
      <li>The dealer must hit until their total is 17 or higher.</li>
      <li>
        If you have a higher total than the dealer without busting, you win!
      </li>
      <li>If you tie with the dealer, it's a push (no one wins).</li>
      <li>If the dealer busts, you win automatically.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card) pays 3:2.</li>
      <li>Winning hands pay even money (1:1).</li>
      <li>If you tie with the dealer, your bet is returned (push).</li>
      <li>If you bust, you lose your bet.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Additional Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can double down after the initial deal, but you must double your
        bet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Splitting pairs allows you to play two hands, but you must place an
        additional bet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Insurance is offered if the dealer's face-up card is an Ace; it pays 2:1
        if the dealer has blackjack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some casinos allow surrendering, where you can forfeit half your bet if
        you think you will lose.
      </li>
    </ul>
