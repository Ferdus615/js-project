# RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR

I have built a random password generator for my personal use and to have a better understanding of the functions in JavaScript.

Your JavaScript function for generating and displaying passwords is well-written, with attention to security and functionality. Here's a breakdown of how it works and some suggestions for improvement:

### **Key Features of My Code**
1. **User Input Handling:**
   - Handles user preferences like password length and inclusion of specific character types.
   - Provides validation for password length (`8-15 characters`) and ensures at least one character type is selected.

2. **Secure Random Number Generation:**
   - Uses `window.crypto.getRandomValues` to generate secure random numbers, which is crucial for password security.

3. **Dynamic Password Display:**
   - Updates the password display element (`showPassword`) dynamically.
   - Includes an SVG for a copy icon with a click event to copy the generated password to the clipboard.

4. **Error Messaging:**
   - Provides user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.
