# Stop Watch

I have mde thsi as a way to test my growth with javaScript and to create something useful.

As I am learnig new thing daily i need to keep a track of time, how much time I am spending on each topic or problems solution. This helps me to keep my attention and focus on solution with 
out any distraction.

So, instead of using other stop watches I just made one for myself just as I like it, with my own style.

### This project help me to understand 
* The use of function and how they work.
* How to dynamicaly update html properties.
* How to build complex logic with simple step.
